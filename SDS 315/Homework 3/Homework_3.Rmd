## Problem 1

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

p1d <- read.csv("gasprices.csv")

# A

boot_p1d_comp = do(10000)*diffmean(Price ~ Competitors, data=resample(p1d))
confint(boot_p1d_comp, level = 0.95)
mean(Price ~ Competitors, data=p1d)

```

The theory is not supported. While the mean price is slightly higher for stations without competition, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means includes zero. This means we cannot confidently say that there is a statistically significant difference in price between gas stations with and without competitors. The observed difference could be due to random chance

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# B
boot_p1d_income = do(10000)*cor(Price ~ Income, data=resample(p1d))
confint(boot_p1d_income, level = 0.95)

```

The theory is supported. The 95% confidence interval for the correlation does not include zero, indicating a statistically significant positive correlation between median household income and gas prices. The correlation coefficient of 0.3962 suggests a moderate positive association. As income increases, gas prices tend to increase as well.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# C
boot_p1d_stop = do(10000)*diffmean(Price ~ Stoplight, data=resample(p1d))
confint(boot_p1d_stop, level = 0.95)
mean(Price ~ Stoplight, data=p1d)

```

The theory is not supported. The mean prices are very similar, and the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means includes zero. Therefore, there is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that gas stations at stoplights charge more than those without.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# D
boot_p1d_high = do(10000)*diffmean(Price ~ Highway, data=resample(p1d))
confint(boot_p1d_high, level = 0.95)
mean(Price ~ Highway, data=p1d)
```

The theory is supported. The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means does not include zero, and the mean price is higher for stations with highway access. This provides evidence that gas stations with direct highway access charge more than those without. The estimated effect size is 0.0457, meaning gas stations with highway access charge approximately 4.6 cents more per gallon, on average.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# E
boot_p1d_brand = do(10000)*diffmean(Price ~ Brand=="Shell", data=resample(p1d))
confint(boot_p1d_brand, level = 0.95)
mean(Price ~ Brand=="Shell", data=p1d)
```

The theory is not clearly supported. The mean price is higher for Shell stations, but the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means includes zero. Therefore, we cannot confidently conclude that Shell stations charge significantly more than other brands based on this sample. There is a slight trend in that direction.
